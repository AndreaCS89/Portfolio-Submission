**# Portfolio-Submission**

This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook for the Pirate Intelligent Agent, a project that demonstrates how reinforcement learning and neural networks can be applied to solve real-world challenges.

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

In this project, I worked with a reinforcement learning model designed to train an intelligent agent, the Pirate, to correctly navigate and achieve best behavior in a specific environment. I was given initial code for the environment setup, basic framework, and utility functions. I created code for implementing the learning agent, defining reward strategies, and increating the agent's performance through iterative improvements. This project definitely allowed me to explore the main concepts of reinforcement learning, including exploration vs. exploitation, reward maximization, and neural network integration for decision making. I learned that applying these concepts practically has increased my understanding of how intelligent agents function.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

Computer scientists create solutions that automate, optimize, and increase different aspects of technology. This work matters because it leads to better efficiency, smarter systems, and ultimately helps improve quality of life through technological innovation. In this project, I approached the problem by understanding the environment and the constraints faced by the agent. From there, I modified the agent's learning parameters, which is a typical computer science approach, which is defined by breaking down a problem, prototype solutions, test, and optimize.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

As a computer scientist, I recognize my ethical responsibilities both to the end user and the organization. It is important to build systems that are fair, secure, and transparent. When designing intelligent agents, it is important to avoid biases that could affect outcomes negatively and to ensure that the technologies we build respect user privacy and maintain trust.
